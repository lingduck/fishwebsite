<h2> This sections is on the Pufferfish.  </h2>

<p> <img src="./src/pufferfish.jpg"style=" width: 900px;"> </p>

<p><b>Tetraodontidae is a family of primarily marine and estuarine fish of the order Tetraodontiformes. The family includes many familiar species <br> variously called pufferfish, puffers, balloonfish, blowfish, blowies, bubblefish, globefish, swellfish, toadfish, toadies, honey toads, sugar toads, <br> and sea squab.[1] They are morphologically similar to the closely related porcupinefish, which have large external spines <br>(unlike the thinner, hidden spines of the Tetraodontidae, which are only visible when the fish have puffed up). The scientific name refers to <br> the four large teeth, fused into an upper and lower plate, which are used for crushing the hard shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their <br> natural prey. </p>
 
<ul>
 	     <li> There are more than 100 species of Puffer fish. They can be found in tropical waters all over the <br> world, such as the Pacific Ocean and the Red Sea. Only 18 species have been recorded in the<br> Maldives. They are mostly bottom fishes that live on either reefs or sand flats. </li>
                       <li> The largest Puffer fish in Maldives is the Starry Puffer fish (Arothron stellatus) growing up to 1 m <br> long. The smallest Puffer fish in Maldives is the White-spotted Puffer fish (Canthigaster <br> janthinoptera) with a length of only 8 cm.   </li>
	       <li> Puffer fish do not have scales. Their skin is thick and rough. Some species have spines on the <br> skin, which offer additional protection against the predators. But they are more sensitive to <br>water variations than other fish, and tend to be more at-risk for diseases.  </li>   
                   </ul>
